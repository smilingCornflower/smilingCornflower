# Hey there! I'm Nauryzbek Turganbayev 😄

I'm a 21-year-old backend developer from Almaty, Kazakhstan 🇰🇿. Currently, I'm studying computer science at Kazakh-British Technical University (KBTU).  
I specialize in building scalable APIs and backend systems using Python 🐍, primarily with FastAPI and Django. I enjoy solving problems independently and never hesitate to take on unfamiliar or complex tasks.  
Teamwork comes naturally to me — I’m easygoing, don’t cause friction, and always try to keep collaboration smooth and productive 🤝.  
Outside of programming, I like playing chess and wathing anime.

## Technologies:
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Django
- **Tools**: Docker, Docker Compose, Git, Redis, Poetry
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Google Cloud, Yandex Cloud
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL

I’m also comfortable building Telegram bots using `aiogram` or `python-telegram-bot`.  
Additionally, I’m learning **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
